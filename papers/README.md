# Differentiable Monte Carlo Ray Tracing through Edge Sampling
## Published
* 2018

## Summary
We introduce a general-purpose differentiable ray tracer, which, to our knowledge, is the first comprehensive solution that is able to compute derivatives of scalar functions over a rendered image with respect to arbitrary scene parameters such as camera pose, scene geometry, materials, and lighting parameters.
