# Differentiable Monte Carlo Ray Tracing through Edge Sampling
### Published
* 2018

### Summary
We introduce a general-purpose differentiable ray tracer, which, to our knowledge, is the first comprehensive solution that is able to compute derivatives of scalar functions over a rendered image with respect to arbitrary scene parameters such as camera pose, scene geometry, materials, and lighting parameters.

# A Differential Theory of Radiative Transfer
### Published
* 2019

### Summary
We introduce a differential theory of radiative transfer, which shows how individual components of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) can be differentiated with respect to arbitrary differentiable changes of a scene.

# Path-Space Differentiable Renderer
### Publised
* 2020

### Summary
Our path-space differentiable rendering formulation allows the design of new Monte Carlo estimators that offer significantly better efficiency than state-of-the-art methods in handling complex geometric discontinuities and light transport phenomena such as caustics.
